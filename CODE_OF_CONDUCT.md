# Code of Conduct

## Collaboration Norms
- Keep discussions technical, specific, and reproducible.
- Critique implementation details, not people.
- Use issue and PR templates as written.
- Escalate blocking disagreements to maintainers with concrete alternatives and tradeoffs.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment or personal attacks.
- Deliberate disruption of issue/PR workflows.
- Posting private or security-sensitive information in public threads.

## Maintainer Actions
Maintainers may edit, lock, or remove comments/issues/PRs that violate these norms.
Maintainers may temporarily or permanently restrict participation for repeated violations.

## Reporting
For conduct issues, open an issue with title prefix `CONDUCT` and include links/screenshots sufficient for review.
If the report includes security-sensitive material, follow `SECURITY.md` instead.
