# Roadmap

## Near term

- Strengthen coherence checks so docs/contracts/exports/examples stay
  synchronized.
- Expand workers validation from example-level to automated harness-level
  checks.
- Add richer eval datasets for multi-shard and overlap-heavy extraction
  scenarios.

## Mid term

- Improve reversible normalization mapping for robust original-text offset
  recovery.
- Add provider retry telemetry and richer diagnostic aggregation in evidence
  bundles.
- Expand visualization with diff views between multiple eval runs.

## Long term

- Add browser-focused packaging path once dist strategy is finalized.
- Provide curated benchmark datasets for reproducible external performance
  baselines.
- Support opt-in advanced schema features while preserving dependency-free core.
